                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi! Iâ€™m Nicholas Ficara. I was born in Ottawa, moved to Montreal when I was young, and finally moved back to Ottawa for grade 9. Technology has always surrounded me the same way planets orbit a star. I started by learning electrical engineering with my grandfather. I began my journey by building circuits on breadboards. However, my curiosity didnâ€™t end there, I wanted to master the most complex and greatest circuit there ever was; the computer. I started learning how to build websites, and eventually moved on to writing mods for video games that I was playing at the time. This created a snowball effect: as I was learning one thing, something else even more interesting popped up, and I eventually found myself hopping from one field in programming to the next. As I developed these skills, I discovered many other interesting fields that can greatly benefit my coding projects. For instance, video editing. I learned how to make good intro clips, how to splice footage, add effects, etc. This helped me promote the apps I have built over the years.

                <h2>Interests</h2>

                <h1>Programming</h1>
                <p>
                    As I already mentioned, programming has been a core part of my life ever since I was young. I decided to pick programming as a topic because there is so much content that can be produced to help people, through the use of media such as infographics and videos. The video below is a map of all of computer science. There are so many different fields that are all so interesting to me. I find this video does a good job of summarising it all. The link points to StackOverflow. This website provides all the support a programmer needs to build anything. Without it, programming would be radically different and very difficult.

                <h1>Video Editing</h1>
                <p>
                    I decided to pick video editing as my second topic because it is something that I really enjoy doing, especially due to the easily presentable and accessible end product. I started editing right once I had a computer that could run editing software. My work at the beginning was pretty bad, but eventually found my groove and started making videos I was proud of. I now use Davinci Resolve, due to its very intuitive interface based around node graphs. This video shows how to use Resolve to make an intro clip. The link is a blog made by CinemaSins. It goes over issues in films like conflicting statements, poorly written lines, bad storylines, etc. I find it very entertaining and I find that I learn a lot to improve my own videos.

                <h1>Piano</h1>
                <p>
                    Another interest of mine has always been the piano. I started playing at four years of age and I am still learning to this day. I find these kinds of videos with midi visualizers super entertaining and interesting to watch. I would love to make one of my own. That song is the one I am currently learning. The link points to a website called musescore. This is where all pianists share their sheet music. Linked is my page with all my favourite songs.

                <h1>Exercise</h1>
                <p>
                    When I was four years old, I started karate. I have been doing it since. I was satisfied with my physical shape, but when I got to Ottawa for grade 9, I discovered weight lifting. I started going to the gym six times a week and getting stronger. I also joined the frisbee team. This is where I met a bunch of my friends. The video is by Jeff Nipard, who has a bachelorâ€™s in biochemistry and a wife who has a Ph.D. in biomechanics. He produces high-quality exercise demonstrations that show off good form and safe lifts. The website is a blog about good workout routines.

                <h1>Yo-Yo</h1>
                <p>
                    In grade 5, I picked up a more rare hobby. For some reason, yo-yos took over my school by storm. In the span of a week, everyone had a yo-yo. For some reason, I never stopped playing with my yo-yo. Here is a video that shows the different levels of yo-yo-ing. (I can do the tricks up until about halfway into the video) The website is a yo-yo store and yo-yo trick Wikipedia. It has lists of all types of tricks. (I do 1A unresponsive tricks)

                <h2>Course Content</h2>
                <p>
                    I am here to learn about the design process that goes into making media. I have a lot of practice with the practical and technical aspects of media production, but I was never good at coming up with ideas for projects. I am excited to show my passions off in photography, graphic design, movie making, etc. For instance, I can combine photography and exercise to make inspirational workout photos. Another example could be combining graphic design with programming to make an infographic about a programming concept. I could also combine moviemaking with piano, as I mentioned before by making the midi notes fall onto the piano like in the video. These are all ways that I can combine what I learn in tech class with my interests and hobbies.
                    <br>
                    Thank you for taking the time to read my website. I took inspiration from a theme but coded it from the ground up all by myself.
