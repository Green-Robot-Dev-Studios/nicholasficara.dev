      <title>How I used Google Docs as a CMS for a Blog Style Website</title>

      <description>I was assigned the task of building a newspaper/blog website for my school. The current website is built with Wix and is not responsive at all. It&amp;rsquo;s also a genuine eyesore to look at.
I decided I needed a CMS to get the rest of the team to be able to write content. I decided I wanted something universal and simple like a folder filled with markdown or html files. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to force the writers to use markdown or html, however, the main thing I wanted to avoid is having to manually copy paste content from Google Docs into a markdown/html file and then re-format everything.</description>

      <title>Are Hackathons Really Worth It?</title>

      <description>Introduction I enjoy hackathons. They force us to complete a project and present it no matter what state it&amp;rsquo;s in. This is the main reason I participate. It forces me to just code and whatever I get done I must present. It contrasts my normal approach to projects, which is to polish to no end and eventually lose interest in the project.
Online Hackathons In the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve been participating in online hackathons.</description>

  Arch Linux pros and cons? Pros:   pacman/AUR
 If pacman doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the package you are looking for, the AUR usually does. It&amp;rsquo;s insanely complete. I personally have 1600 packages installed, and I only had to install 2 programs that weren&amp;rsquo;t provided in the AUR.</description>

      <title>Fractals as a Live Wallpaper</title>

      <description>I have always loved fractals. Something about the Mandelbrot set is so captivating to me. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to write my own implementation of it and I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to use it as my wallpaper, so I decided why not combine both! I wrote a live wallpaper program for Linux that will render the Mandelbrot set to your X root window (desktop). It was a lot of fun to implement, and very rewarding.</description>

      <title>My experience using Svelte</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago I started building a web app to anonymously connect students with trained peers. The project needed to be on a small budget (aka free). Most of the stuff I build is on a similar budget, and by that I mean the exact same budget. This is good in some ways. It teaches me to be resourceful and use the free tools at my disposal and work around the old school way of hosting a MySQL server (which I have done ðŸ˜¢).</description>

      <title>Why Build a Gameboy Emulator</title>

      <description>I think everyone should build an emulator and some point or another.
I was recently playing some Pokemon Red on the original Gameboy. Something about the game captivates me. A large portion of this appeal comes from the emulator. I find it fascinating how we can now run an emulator on almost any platform. I decided I wanted to build and emulator so that I could have a full understanding of the Gameboy.</description>

      <title>Drawing Pictures in Desmos</title>

      <description>I was messing around with various APIs and I stumbled across a feature in Desmos that allows you to place a colored pixel anywhere on the graph. I instantly wanted to set up a script that would draw out an image.
I decided to start small and make an apple. Here is the original image (low res for performance):
Now I made each pixel of that apple a point on desmos:</description>

      <title>Making YouTube Videos Completely Automatically</title>

      <description>I came across this type of channel on YouTube called Reddit readers. They use a text to speech software or a human voice over to read Reddit posts. There are plenty of them if you search up reddit reader. I realized that this is probably possible to do without any human interaction whatsoever.
What I Built This was the final product: https://youtu.be/8QHTimxYGes. I simply put in a Reddit link and it did the rest.</description>

      <description>I made a python script that takes your webcam&amp;rsquo;s pixels, converts them to Minecraft blocks, then passes them to a datapack that places the blocks in your Minecraft&amp;rsquo;s world! Here is an example:
It maps each pixel color in the webcam to a concrete color in Minecraft. It was quite fun to build and a nice weekend project!</description>

      <description>People are spending way too much time on their phones right now all cooped up in their houses. I decided to tackle this problem by building Scroll n Stroll. An app, as the name suggests, where you need to amass steps in order to increase your screen time allowance. The app is not yet published, but I learned a lot while building it. I learned flutter while building it. I had a great experience using flutter.</description>

      <title>p5js as a Learning Tool</title>
      <link>https://nicholasficara.dev/blog/p5js-as-a-learning-tool/</link>

      <guid>https://nicholasficara.dev/blog/p5js-as-a-learning-tool/</guid>
      <description>p5js is a graphics library for javascript that is a port of the Processing language. p5js is incredibly simple. It&amp;rsquo;s about as close to English as you can get. For example, take a look at the reference: https://p5js.org/reference/. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need to read the description of each function to know what it does. It&amp;rsquo;s dead simple. This is not great for performance, and I still stick to using the canvas API itself for most large scale projects, but for simple simulations it&amp;rsquo;s very powerful.</description>
