  <p>p5js is a graphics library for javascript that is a port of the Processing language. p5js is incredibly simple. It&rsquo;s about as close to English as you can get. For example, take a look at the reference: <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">https://p5js.org/reference/</a>. You don&rsquo;t even need to read the description of each function to know what it does. It&rsquo;s dead simple. This is not great for performance, and I still stick to using the canvas API itself for most large scale projects, but for simple simulations it&rsquo;s very powerful.</p>
<h2 id="p5js-as-a-learning-tool">p5js as a Learning Tool</h2>
<p>One way I enjoy learning at school is by teaching what I know to a computer. Computers are exceptionally dumb, and can&rsquo;t infer any context. This forces you to have to teach the computer the ins and outs of a given topic. I enjoy building physics, chem and math simulations using p5js. I always feel more comfortable around a subject when I&rsquo;ve built a simulation for it. Additionally, I share it with my friends and they always find it fun. Here is an example: <a href="https://nicholasficara.dev/other/school/motionsim/">https://nicholasficara.dev/other/school/motionsim/</a>. This simulation simulates one dimensional motion and energy loss.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You should try this out! I promise with a few videos of The Coding Train, p5js will be second nature.</p>
