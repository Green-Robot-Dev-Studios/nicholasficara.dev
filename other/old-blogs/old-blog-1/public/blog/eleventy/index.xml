      <description>I was assigned the task of building a newspaper/blog website for my school. The current website is built with Wix and is not responsive at all. It&amp;rsquo;s also a genuine eyesore to look at.
I decided I needed a CMS to get the rest of the team to be able to write content. I decided I wanted something universal and simple like a folder filled with markdown or html files. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to force the writers to use markdown or html, however, the main thing I wanted to avoid is having to manually copy paste content from Google Docs into a markdown/html file and then re-format everything.</description>
