# Logic

## 5 minute cram:

A logic:
- Syntax
    - Defines the language of the logic.
    - Defines the rules for constructing sentences in the language.
- Semantics: Defines $\equality$ and $\vDash$ for the logic.
    - $\vDash$ means "logically implies".
    - $\equality$ means "is logically equivalent to".
- Proof theory: Defines $\vdash$.
    - $P_1, P_2, P_3 \vdash Q$ means we can prove $Q$ from $P_1, P_2, P_3$.

## Soundness and Completeness

- Soundness: If $P_1, P_2, P_3 \vdash Q$ then $P_1, P_2, P_3 \vDash Q$.
    - In other words, if we can prove $Q$ from $P_1, P_2, P_3$ then $Q$ is true in all models of $P_1, P_2, P_3$. Meaning **we can't prove anything that is false**.
- Completeness: If $P_1, P_2, P_3 \vDash Q$ then $P_1, P_2, P_3 \vdash Q$.
    - In other words, if $Q$ is true in all models of $P_1, P_2, P_3$ then we can prove $Q$ from $P_1, P_2, P_3$. Meaning **we can prove anything that is true**.
