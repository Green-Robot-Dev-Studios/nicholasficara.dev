# Transformational Proofs

- `comm_assoc`
    - Associativity of operations. Think $P \land Q$ is the same as $Q \land P$
- `distr`
    - Distributivity of operations. Think $P \land (Q \lor R)$ is the same as $(P \land Q) \lor (P \land R)$
- `equiv`
    - Equivalence. Think $P ⇔ Q ↔ (P ⇒ Q) ∧ (Q ⇒ P)$
- `dm`
    - De Morgan's Law. Think $¬(P \lor Q) ↔ ¬P ∧ ¬Q$
- `simp1`
    - Simplification. Think about simplifying a **boolean valuation**, so something like $P ∧ true ↔ P$
- `simp2`
    - Simplication of **two (2)** variables. Think $P \lor (P ∧ Q) ↔ P$
- `idemp`
    - Idempotency. Think simplification of **the same variable**. $P \lor P ↔ P$
- `neg`
    - Negation. Think $¬(¬P) ↔ P$
- `contr`
    - Contradiction. Think $P ∧ ¬P ↔ false$
- `lem`
    - Law of Excluded Middle. Think $P \lor ¬P ↔ true$
- `impl`
    - Implication. Think $P ⇒ Q ↔ ¬P \lor Q$
- `contrapos`
    - Contrapositive. Think $P ⇒ Q ↔ ¬Q ⇒ ¬P$

:::note
When the quesetion says to check if two formulas are logically equivalent, use the `<->` or $↔$ symbol between the formulas.

## CNF & DNF

- CNF: Conjunctive Normal Form
    - A formula is in CNF if it is a conjunction of disjunctions of literals
- DNF: Disjunctive Normal Form
    - A formula is in DNF if it is a disjunction of conjunctions of literals
- `false` and `true` are both CNF & DNF
- If `false` or `true` appear elsewhere in a formula, it is neither CNF nor DNF

:::note
A literal is a variable or its negation.
:::

:::caution
A formula can be both CNF and DNF. Check for both definitions. See the quiz below.

    "both",
    "neither",
    "CNF",
    "DNF"
]} why="Obviously it's CNF, but it's also DNF because if you consider the entire equation as one, it's like a disjunction with nothing." />
