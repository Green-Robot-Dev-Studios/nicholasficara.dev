                  A fun, <i>easy to pick up</i> hobby that will last a lifetime. Yo-Yo-ers come in all shapes and sizes, with no barrier to entry. If you‚Äôve ever thought of picking up the hobby or it‚Äôs even a possibility, I guarantee this article will inspire you to go for your first throw and try your first trick! Although any yo-yo will work, there is a special kind of yo-yo that unlocks a pandora‚Äôs box of new tricks you can do. This is called an unresponsive yo-yo. Here is a photo of mine:

                  The term unresponsive refers to the fact that it won‚Äôt come up when you tug on the string. This is intended behavior (no the yo-yo isn‚Äôt broken). This unresponsiveness allows you to do some faster paced tricks without running the risk of the yo-yo coming back up mid-trick. What about bringing the yo-yo back up, I hear you ask? In order to bring the yo-yo back up, called binding, all you need to do is wrap your string-hand around the yo-yo and pull up quickly. Here is an image of the yo-yo spinning at the bottom of the string:
                  <img src="../assets/5.jpg" width="50%"/>
                  Some easy tricks to get started with yo-yo-ing are called string tricks.

                  <i>No, not like this.</i>
                  <br>
                  These are tricks that don‚Äôt involve the yo-yo at all! All you have to do is throw the yo-yo, then shape the string into any shape you want! Here is a picture of the ‚ÄúEiffel Tower‚Äù string trick:

                  The next important step is learning the main positions. These include the forward half mount, breakaway mount, double forward mount, etc. Here is a photo of the forward half mount:

                  The next time you are at your local hobby store or need something fun and refreshing to do, maybe consider picking up a yo-yo!
